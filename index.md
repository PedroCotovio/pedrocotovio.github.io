## About Me

As a PhD student and a Teaching Assistant at the <a target="_blank" href="https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/">Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon</a> (FCUL), and as a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lasige.pt/">LASIGE</a> research group, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between artificial neural networks and their biological counterparts.

Under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~catiapesquita/">Dr. Catia Pesquita</a>, an associate professor at FCUL, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/ernesto-jimenez-ruiz">Dr Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz</a>, a Lecturer of Artificial Intelligence at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/science-technology">School of Science & Technology of City, University of London </a> I am working on using Neuro-Symbolic AI to improve Knowledge Graph Alignment.

Previously, I conducted research using deep reinforcement learning approaches to improve algorithms for n-way data analysis.

## Research Interests

I am currently mainly interested Neuro-Symbolic AI but my interests expand to all things deep & reinforcement learning.

* Neuro-Symbolic AI
* Deep Learning
* Reinforcement Learning
* Knowledge Graph Alignment / Ontology Matching

My interest go much further than these topics, so if you would like to collaborate feel free to [contact me](#contact).
