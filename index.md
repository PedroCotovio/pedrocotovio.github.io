## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpeg">

I am a PhD student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/">Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon</a> (FCUL), conducting research at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lasige.pt/">LASIGE</a>. I am supervised by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~catiapesquita/">Professor Catia Pesquita</a> from FCUL and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/ernesto-jimenez-ruiz">Dr Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz</a> Lecturer of Artificial Intelligence at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/science-technology">School of Science & Technology of City, University of London </a>.

I am interested in shortening the gap between artificial nets and their biological counterparts, currently my research focuses on using Neuro-Symbolic AI to improve Knowledge Graph Alignment.

I have previously conducted research that focused on using deep reinforcement learning approaches to improve algorithms for n-way data analysis.

For a more thorough and structured description of my work you may [contact me](#contact) and request my CV.

## Research Interests

I am currently mainly interested Neuro-Symbolic AI but my interests expand to all things deep & reinforcement learning.

* Neuro-Symbolic AI
* Deep Learning
* Reinforcement Learning
* Bioinformatics
* Semantic Web
* Knowledge Graph Alignment / Ontology Matching
* Cognition

My interest go much further than these topics, so if you would like to collaborate on any problem that I might be of use, feel free to [contact me](#contact).
